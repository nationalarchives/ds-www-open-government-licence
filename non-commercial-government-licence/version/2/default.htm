      <h2>
      Governing Law
      </h2>

      </p>

      <h2>
      Definitions
      </h2>
<p>In this licence the terms below have the following meanings:</p>

      <p><strong>‘Information’</strong><br />

    means information protected by copyright or by database right (for example, literary and artistic works, content, data and source code) offered for use under the terms of this licence.</p>

      <p><strong>‘Information Provider’</strong><br />
      means the person or organisation providing the Information under this licence.
</p>
      <p><strong>‘Licensor’</strong><br />
    means any Information Provider which has the authority to offer Information under the terms of this licence or the Keeper of the Public Records, who has the authority to offer Information subject to Crown copyright and Crown database rights and Information subject to copyright and database right that has been assigned to or acquired by the Crown, under the terms of this licence. </p>

          <p><strong>‘Non-Commercial purposes’</strong><br />
    means not intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.  For the purposes of this licence, ‘private monetary compensation’ does not include the exchange of the Information for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of the Information.</p>


      <p><strong>‘Use’</strong><br />
      as a verb, means doing any act which is restricted by copyright or database right, whether in the original medium or in any other medium, and includes without limitation distributing, copying, adapting, modifying as may be technically necessary to use it in a different mode or format.

means the natural or legal person, or body of persons corporate or incorporate, acquiring rights under this licence.</p>

<h2> About the Non-Commercial Government Licence</h2>

<p>The National Archives has developed this licence as a tool to enable Information Providers in the public sector to license the use and re-use of their Information under a common non-commercial licence. The National Archives invites public sector bodies owning their own copyright and database rights to permit the use of their Information under this licence where licensing under the default Open Government Licence is not appropriate.</p>

<p>The Keeper of the Public Records has authority to license Information subject to copyright and database right owned by the Crown.</p>

<p>This is version 2.0 of the Non-Commercial Government Licence. The National Archives may, from time to time, issue new versions of the Non-Commercial Government Licence. If you are already using information under a previous version of the Non-Commercial Government Licence, the terms of that licence will continue to apply.</p>

<p>Further context, best practice and guidance can be found in the UK Government Licensing Framework section on <a href="/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/uk-government-licensing-framework/">The National Archives website </a>.</p>
